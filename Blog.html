<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have you talked about your life with a stranger? Well, if you haven't done that, neither have I. This is my first time writing about my life on the internet and basically sharing it with strangers. You may or may not know me, but I'll introduce myself anyway. My name is Luthy Jane Bontong; some of my friends call me Luthy, Luths, Kulot, Lotlot, Jane, and LJ, but I prefer to be called LJ. I am now 21 years old, having been born on February 5, 2001. I am currently studying at the University of Science and Technology of the Southern Philippines College, taking up a Bachelor of Science in Technology Communication Management as a freshman. Yes, you read it right. I am still in my freshman year. It is only because I couldn't afford to send myself to college before. Actually, I did study college before, way back in 2019, but I stopped for the reason that I didn't get a chance to pass the scholarship that I applied for. Since I stopped, I have had to save money to pay my debt at school. After 3 years of saving, I finally got the chance to get my credentials from my previous school and take my chances to apply to my dream school.</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To sum it all up, I am now in my dream school and taking my desired course. As of the moment, I don't know if it's really worth it because of the pressure, but I had to think of it in a positive way. As long as I have my family as my motivation, I know I can do it all. Anyway, let's talk about my favorites. Since I am a chubby teen, I love eating ice cream, specifically cookies and cream-flavored ice cream. I am also in love with fried chicken, to the point that I can call myself addicted to it. My favorite colors are purple and yellow. I love cats and dogs; as of now, I have three cats and one dog. They are all lovely, like me. My fur babies are my best friends. They comfort me when my anxiety attacks. I think that's all I can share about myself. If you read up to this point, I am sending you a virtual hug.</p>
